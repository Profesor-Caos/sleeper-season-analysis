                <p>A big congratulations to our champion @CeeLoGreen97! </p>
                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">
                    <p>Conor went 13-1 in the regular season and continued the dominance into the postseason by taking
                        home the
                        championship trophy. </p>
                    <p>If it's any consolation for the rest of us, this is dynasty, and Connor did draft the oldest
                        team.
                    </p>
                    <p>Those veterans paid off big time, by scoring the most points in the league by far - with his
                        average points scored exceeding the league average by almost 22%. </p>
                    <p>Lamar, Baker, and Saquon combined to annihilate the competition, proving the importance of
                        Quarterbacks in this Superflex format. </p>
                    <p>His road through the regular season was also very favorable, getting to face our bottom two teams
                        both twice (sorry Gwen and Ira). </p>
                    <p>Against other teams, his opponents on average scored 4.5% lower than the league average, a number
                        brought down both by getting to face Gwen and Ira each twice, but also by not having to face
                        himself
                        (normalizing against league averages definitely makes a difference when all the other teams had
                        Connor dropping a stupid amount of points on them). </p>
                    <p>Facing his mighty squad had his opponents shaking in their boots. - Despite his opponents scoring
                        just 4.5% under the league average against other opponents, when
                        against Connor, those same teams scored almost 8.6% lower than the league average,
                        underperforming their expectations big time.</p>
                    <p>We'll see if he can repeat his ridiculous performance next year.</p>

                <p>A round of applause for our runner up! @rynoceros17 had a strong finish after a rocky 2-4 start to

                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">
                    <p>Making the playoffs was a close call, ending the last 4 games of the season with a scary 2 losses
                        in a row, then finishing strong with 2 wins to clinch it.</p>
                    <p>Ryan's was another team that had a fairly lucky run into the playoffs, facing about an average
                        strength of schedule, but having teams underperform their expectations by about 5%, allowing a
                        team that scored in the bottom half of the league in points for to sneak into the playoffs.</p>
                    <p>But that's not where Ryan's story ended - a couple wins in the playoffs, and he brought home
                        silver. You never know what's going to happen in Fantasy! Patrick Mahomes was a strong QB leader
                        for the team, and RB De'Von Achane scored big, including in the playoffs when it mattered -
                        while rookies Bucky Irving and Malik Nabers shone bright.</p>

                    <p>While his strength of schedule was fairly middling, scoring the 7th most points, against Abe,

                    <p>The most impressive part about Abe's season was the turnaround. After starter 1-4 and then 2-6,
                        Abe won 6 straight games to finish the season with one of the best records in the league.</p>
                    <p>Josh Allen and Justin Herbert proved their QB talent, while Taylor Swift's boyfriend continuing
                        to put up decent points and a mid-season trade for Drake London helped secure a playoff spot

                    <p>I thought that would be the case as well, but she faced the hardest strength of schedule in the

                    <p>Although I finished 5-9, I started 0-4 and at one point was 2-8 - certainly outside of playoff

                        me, resulting in having the 2nd most points against me. Looks like I need to learn how to play
                        defense too.</p>
                    <p>I certainly made the most trades in the season, after Tua suffered a concussion early in the
