            <div class="mt-2 space-y-2 hidden">
                <p>A big congratulations to @CeeLoGreen97! </p>
                <p>13-1 in the regular season and he continued the dominance into the postseason by taking home the
                    championship trophy. </p>
                <p>If it's any consolation for the rest of us, this is dynasty, and Connor did draft the oldest team.
                </p>
                <p>Those veterans paid off big time, by scoring the most points in the league by far - with his average
                    points scored exceeding the league average by almost 22%. </p>
                <p>Lamar, Baker, and Saquon combined to annihilate the competition, proving the importance of
                    Quarterbacks in this Superflex format. </p>
                <p>His road through the regular season was also very favorable, getting to face our bottom two teams
                    both twice (sorry Gwen and Ira). </p>
                <p>Against other teams, his opponents on average scored 4.5% lower than the league average, a number
                    brought down both by getting to face Gwen and Ira each twice, but also by not having to face himself
                    (normalizing against league averages definitely makes a difference when all the other teams had
                    Connor dropping a stupid amount of points on them). </p>
                <p>Facing his mighty squad had his opponents shaking in their boots.</p>
                <p>Despite his opponents scoring just 4.5% under the league average against other opponents, when
                    against Connor, those same teams scored almost 8.6% lower than the league average, underperforming
                    their expectations big time.</p>
                <p>We'll see if he can repeat his ridiculous performance next year.</p>

            <div class="mt-2 space-y-2 hidden">
                <p>A round of applause for our runner up! @rynoceros17 had a strong finish after a rocky 2-4 start to
                    the season. </p>
                <p>Making the playoffs was a close call, ending the last 4 games of the season with a scary 2 losses in
                    a row, then finishing strong with 2 wins to clinch it. </p>
                <p>Ryan's was another team that had a fairly lucky run into the playoffs, facing about an average
                    strength of schedule, </p>
                <p>but having teams underperform their expectations by about 5%, allowing a team that scored in the
                    bottom half of the league in points for to sneak into the playoffs. </p>
                <p>But that's not where Ryan's story ended - a couple wins in the playoffs, and he brought home silver.
                    You never know what's going to happen in Fantasy! </p>
                <p>Patrick Mahomes was a strong QB leader for the team, and RB De'Von Achane scored big, including in
                    the playoffs when it mattered - </p>
                <p>while rookies Bucky Irving and Malik Nabers shone bright.</p>

            <div class="mt-2 space-y-2 hidden">
                <p>And @SgtWeenieArms gets the bronze! Abe had a solid squad that scored the 3rd most points. </p>
                <p>While his strength of schedule was fairly middling, scoring the 7th most points, against Abe, those
                    teams
                    outperformed by 2%, resulting in the 5th most points scored against him. </p>
                <p>Josh Allen and Justin Herbert proved their QB talent, while Taylor Swift's boyfriend continuing to
                    put up
                    decent points and a mid-season trade for Drake London helped secure a playoff spot after an
                    unfortunate 1-4
                    start.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">üéâ The Honorable Mentions</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Sera - Dynasty Gourmand</h3>
        <p>@PrincessofRaven finished the regular season with the 2nd strongest record at 9-5, and taking the 4th place
            finish in the playoffs. </p>
        <p>Interestingly, while she had the 2nd best record, her points for during the regular season were 3rd lowest in
            the league. </p>
        <p>So certainly, her strength of schedule must have been a cakewalk, right? </p>
        <p>I thought that would be the case as well, but she faced the hardest strength of schedule in the league,
            facing both Abe and Josh twice. </p>
        <p>Against her, teams underperformed their average performances by 8.8%, showing the incredible variance that
            can happen in Fantasy Football. </p>
        <p>Jalen Hurts led the effort, hindered by an injured Rashee Rice and Brandon Aiyuk, while James Conner, Aaron
            Jones, and Courtland Sutton provided consistent points.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Josh - Joshi</h3>
        <p>@yoahiwa had a dominant regular season, scoring the 2nd most points in the league and handing Connor his only
            loss all year. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Josh, while the schedule was not overly difficult, teams overperformed and he faced the 3rd
            most points against. </p>
        <p>Sam Darnold was a surprising points leader for the squad, while Derick Henry and Amon-Ra St. Brown put up
            more expected but nonetheless powerful performances.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Bryce - Mormen less problems</h3>
        <p>@jazzyjackalope led an unlucky squad that scored 5th most in the league to a solid 8-6 record against the
            most points scored by opponents. </p>
        <p>While the strength of schedule was very average, Bryce's opponents outperformed their expected scores by over
            9%. </p>
        <p>Bo Nix performed well as a rookie, while Bijan Robinson, James Cook, and Jonathon Taylor were a terrific RB
            trio. Maybe next season you should play better defense :P</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">‚öñÔ∏è Those who missed the playoffs</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Gabe - Godo(n)t stop me</h3>
        <p>After a blazing 6-2 start, @EmpiricalFool must have made a coaching change or something (sorry Gabe),
            suffering heartbreaking defeat after heartbreaking defeat as the team collapsed to a 7-7 final record. </p>
        <p>The team was among the most statistically average in the league, almost even in points for and points again,
            with a moderately difficult strength of schedule that ended up underperforming against him. </p>
        <p>Baker Mayfield led the team, but was traded to CeeLoGreen97 in the playoffs. Jahmyr Gibbs and Kyren Williams
            were some of the league's top RBs. </p>
        <p>Ladd McConkey showed a lot of promise as a young WR, and Michael Penix hopes to be a strong QB for the
            Falcons' future.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Chelsea - Supermassive Black Hole</h3>
        <p>The other team that finished 7-7, @xXTeamJacobXx similarly had a hot 5-2 start, putting up wins against some
            of the easier teams in the league. </p>
        <p>However, the squad faded down the stretch, losing in valiantly efforts against some of the best teams. </p>
        <p>The team was also very statistically average, averaging just 0.0016 points per game shy of the league
            average. </p>
        <p>The strength of schedule was around the most average, with opponents performing about as expected. </p>
        <p>Joe Burrow was a standout leader on the roster, and AJ Brown continued to be a reliable WR1 (Wide Receiver 1,
            i.e. a top 12 WR). </p>
        <p>Hopefully, Marvin Harrison lives up to his expectations in the coming season.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Conor - The Wright Stuff</h3>
        <p>It was a difficult season for @TwiceMarked, as what was a solid team all around that started 5-3, slid to a
            sad 6-8 record. </p>
        <p>It would seem the 4th highest scoring team should have done better than 6-8, but Conor fell on the wrong side
            of variance as his points were just barely insufficient too many times. </p>
        <p>I really should have done some margin of victory/defeat analysis too. Maybe next year. </p>
        <p>Jared Goff, Justin Jefferson, and Kyler Murray all had good years as expected, while Terry McLaurin had a
            career year with the best QB he's ever had throwing him the ball. </p>
        <p>Finally, we'll see if JJ McCarthy will step up as the Vikings QB next year.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">‚ò†Ô∏è Here lies the remainder</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Ryan G - Team ProfesorCaos</h3>
        <p>At 5-9, I wasn't sure if I should consider myself a team who missed the playoffs or this category, but then I
            recalled how my season went. </p>
        <p>Although I finished 5-9, I started 0-4 and at one point was 2-8 - certainly outside of playoff contention.
        </p>
        <p>Statistically, I did score around the same range of points as teams that made or just missed the playoffs -
            7th most points scored. </p>
        <p>While my strength of schedule was very average, teams scored over 6.3% more than expected against me,
            resulting in having the 2nd most points against me. </p>
        <p>Looks like I need to learn how to play defense too. </p>
        <p>I certainly made the most trades in the season, after Tua suffered a concussion early in the season and my RB
            depth proved lackluster, I decided it wasn't my year. </p>
        <p>Alas, Ja'Marr Chase's career year was wasted. Puka Nacua continued to be great when healthy, and rookie Caleb
            Williams looked okay as Bears fans hope he becomes a top QB soon.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Gwen - ZZ Bottom</h3>
        <p>A team that started out as a rebuilding squad, @dontwearsandals drafted a lot of young players, many of whom
            hit big in their rookie season. </p>
        <p>Don't let the 4-10 record fool you - this team should have been a lot worse than that. </p>
        <p>Despite having the fewest points scored in the league, a favorable strength of schedule and opponents
            underperforming by over 4.5% propelled this young band of up-and-comers to a better record than expected.
        </p>
        <p>But while the record was bad this year, look out for the future. </p>
        <p>CeeDee Lamb gave veteran leadership as youngsters Jayden Daniels, Brock Bowers, and Brian Thomas Jr. all
            exploded onto the scene. </p>
        <p>Gwen's team can be expected to be much stronger next year.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Ira - Carradine Curtain Cords</h3>
        <p>It was a rough season for @RustySporxxx, as his first round pick, Christian McCaffrey, missed the first half
            of the season, and didn't even play 4 games all year. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the lineup was set rather inconsistently, and a lot of potential points were left on the bench
            throughout the year. </p>
        <p>Ira's points for were 2nd lowest in the league, but he faced more points scored against him than Gwen,
            granting him the bottom position on the season. </p>
        <p>There's still a lot of promise on the roster, as Trevor Lawrence got a new WR drafted 2nd overall in this
            year's draft, </p>
        <p>and the young WR trio of Zay Flowers, George Pickens, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba will be good for years to come.
