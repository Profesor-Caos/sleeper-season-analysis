                <p>A big congratulations to our champion @CeeLoGreen97! </p>
                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">
                    <p>Conor went 13-1 in the regular season and continued the dominance into the postseason by taking
                        home the
                        championship trophy. </p>
                    <p>If it's any consolation for the rest of us, this is dynasty, and Connor did draft the oldest
                        team.
                    </p>
                    <p>Those veterans paid off big time, by scoring the most points in the league by far - with his
                        average points scored exceeding the league average by almost 22%. </p>
                    <p>Lamar, Baker, and Saquon combined to annihilate the competition, proving the importance of
                        Quarterbacks in this Superflex format. </p>
                    <p>His road through the regular season was also very favorable, getting to face our bottom two teams
                        both twice (sorry Gwen and Ira). </p>
                    <p>Against other teams, his opponents on average scored 4.5% lower than the league average, a number
                        brought down both by getting to face Gwen and Ira each twice, but also by not having to face
                        himself
                        (normalizing against league averages definitely makes a difference when all the other teams had
                        Connor dropping a stupid amount of points on them). </p>
                    <p>Facing his mighty squad had his opponents shaking in their boots. - Despite his opponents scoring
                        just 4.5% under the league average against other opponents, when
                        against Connor, those same teams scored almost 8.6% lower than the league average,
                        underperforming their expectations big time.</p>
                    <p>We'll see if he can repeat his ridiculous performance next year.</p>

            <div class="space-y-2 ml-6 mr-6 mt-2">
                <p>A round of applause for our runner up! @rynoceros17 had a strong finish after a rocky 2-4 start to
                    the season.</p>
                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">
                    <p>Making the playoffs was a close call, ending the last 4 games of the season with a scary 2 losses
                        in a row, then finishing strong with 2 wins to clinch it.</p>
                    <p>Ryan's was another team that had a fairly lucky run into the playoffs, facing about an average
                        strength of schedule, but having teams underperform their expectations by about 5%, allowing a
                        team that scored in the bottom half of the league in points for to sneak into the playoffs.</p>
                    <p>But that's not where Ryan's story ended - a couple wins in the playoffs, and he brought home
                        silver. You never know what's going to happen in Fantasy! Patrick Mahomes was a strong QB leader
                        for the team, and RB De'Von Achane scored big, including in the playoffs when it mattered -
                        while rookies Bucky Irving and Malik Nabers shone bright.</p>

            <div class="space-y-2 ml-6 mr-6 mt-2">
                <p>And @SgtWeenieArms gets the bronze! Abe had a solid squad that scored the 3rd most points.</p>
                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">
                    <p>While his strength of schedule was fairly middling, scoring the 7th most points, against Abe,
                        those teams overperformed by 2%, resulting in the 5th most points scored against him.</p>
                    <p>The most impressive part about Abe's season was the turnaround. After starter 1-4 and then 2-6,
                        Abe won 6 straight games to finish the season with one of the best records in the league.</p>
                    <p>Josh Allen and Justin Herbert proved their QB talent, while Taylor Swift's boyfriend continuing
                        to put up decent points and a mid-season trade for Drake London helped secure a playoff spot
                        after that unfortunate start.</p>

                        right?</p>
                    <p>I thought that would be the case as well, but she faced the hardest strength of schedule in the
                        league, facing both Abe and Josh twice.</p>
                    <p>Against her, teams underperformed their average performances by 8.8%, showing the incredible
                        variance that can happen in Fantasy Football.</p>
                    <p>Jalen Hurts led the effort, hindered by an injured Rashee Rice and Brandon Aiyuk, while James
                        Conner, Aaron Jones, and Courtland Sutton provided consistent points.</p>

                    <p>Sam Darnold was a surprising points leader for the squad, while Derick Henry and Amon-Ra St.

                    <p>After starting out with a strong 4-0 record, the squad had a tougher time,

                    <p>Bo Nix performed well as a rookie, while Bijan Robinson, James Cook, and Jonathon Taylor were a

                    suffering heartbreaking defeat after heartbreaking defeat as the team collapsed to a 7-7 final

                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">

                    <p>Baker Mayfield led the team, but was traded to CeeLoGreen97 in the playoffs. Jahmyr Gibbs and

                    <p>Ladd McConkey showed a lot of promise as a young WR, and Michael Penix hopes to be a strong QB

                        about as expected.</p>
                    <p>Joe Burrow was a standout leader on the roster, and AJ Brown continued to be a reliable WR1 (Wide

                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">
                    <p>Although I finished 5-9, I started 0-4 and at one point was 2-8 - certainly outside of playoff
                        contention.</p>
                    <p>Statistically, I did score around the same range of points as teams that made or just missed the

                    <p>While my strength of schedule was very average, teams scored over 6.3% more than expected against
                        me, resulting in having the 2nd most points against me. Looks like I need to learn how to play
                        defense too.</p>
                    <p>I certainly made the most trades in the season, after Tua suffered a concussion early in the
                        season and my RB depth proved lackluster, I decided it wasn't my year. Alas, Ja'Marr Chase's
                        career year was wasted. Puka Nacua continued to be great when healthy, and rookie Caleb Williams

                        opponents underperforming by over 4.5% propelled this young band of up-and-comers to a better
                        record than expected.</p>
                    <p>But while the record was bad this year, look out for the future. CeeDee Lamb gave veteran
                        leadership as youngsters Jayden Daniels, Brock Bowers, and Brian Thomas Jr. all exploded onto
                        the scene. Gwen's team can be expected to be much stronger next year.</p>

                <p>It was a rough season for @RustySporxxx, as his first round pick, Christian McCaffrey, missed the
                    first half of the season, and didn't even play 4 games all year.</p>
                <div class="hidden more-content space-y-2">
                    <p>Unfortunately, the lineup was set rather inconsistently, and a lot of potential points were left
                        on the bench throughout the year.</p>
                    <p>Ira's points for were 2nd lowest in the league, but he faced more points scored against him than
                        Gwen, granting him the bottom position on the season.</p>
                    <p>There's still a lot of promise on the roster, as Trevor Lawrence got a new WR drafted 2nd overall
                        in this year's draft, and the young WR trio of Zay Flowers, George Pickens, and Jaxon
                        Smith-Njigba will be good for years to come.</p>
